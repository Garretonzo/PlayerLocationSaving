# PlayerLocationSaving
**Continue your adventure! Log in where you left off!**  
Have you ever wished you could continue your adventure exactly where you last logged out at without starting all the way back from your spawn?  
Then this mod is for you.  
  
**About:**  
Player Location Saving is a simple mod that saves player location on logout, and returns players to their saved locations when logging back in.  
The mod is compatible with both singleplayer and multiplayer worlds/servers.  
The only thing this mod manipulates is the player's position, which happens a single time after they finish loading into the world.  
  
**Upcoming Features:**  
Currently, the mod saves the player position data when the player chooses Save and Exit through the in-game menu. I will change this in a future update so that the save happens periodically in case of the game closing unexpectedly.  
  
**A bit of background:**  
I was surprised to learn that player location is reset each time you exit/enter a world. To me, this should never have been a "feature" of the base game. Log out and get teleported back outside of the dungeon you are currently in the middle of spelunking? No thanks!  
  
I am still rather new to this game and community, yet it wasn't hard to see that you guys are quite awesome so I wanted to share with you something I created.  
  
I am aware that the feature this mod provides is available through other mods/overhauls, but I was unable to find a mod that provides this functionality 1) as a standalone mod (not part of an entire game overhaul) and 2) for both singleplayer and multiplayer servers.  
  
Hope you enjoy. Feedback, suggestions and questions are all welcome!  
Thank you for reading,  
Garret
