# PlayerLocationSaving

**About**
Player Location Saving is a simple mod that saves player location on logout, and returns players to their saved locations when logging back in.
The mod is compatible with both singleplayer and multiplayer worlds/servers.


**Upcoming Features:**
Currently, the mod saves the player position data when the player chooses Save and Exit through the in-game menu. I will change this in a future version so that the save happens periodically in case of the game closing unexpectedly.


**A bit of background:**
I was much surprised to learn that player location is reset each time you enter a world. To me, this should never have been a "feature" of the base game.
I am still rather new to this game and community, yet it wasn't hard to see that you guys are quite awesome so I wanted to share with you something I created.

I am aware that the feature this mod provides is available through other mods/overhauls, but I was unable to find a mod that provides this functionality 1) standalone and 2) for both singleplayer and multiplayer servers.


Hope you enjoy. Feedback, suggestions and questions are all welcome!
Thank you for reading,
Garret
